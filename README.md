# vulnscanner
VulnScanner is a Bash + Python hybrid tool built for Kali Linux that automates web and service vulnerability discovery, CVE enrichment, and exploitability checks.  It combines well-known security tools (nmap, nikto, gobuster, searchsploit) with the NVD API (nvdlib) to generate a professional vulnerability report.
